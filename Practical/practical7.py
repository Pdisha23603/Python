# Program to find Greatest Common Divisor of two numbers. For example, theGCD of 20 and 28 is 4 and the GCD of 98 and 56 is 14.

import math
num1 = int(input("enter firt number: "))
num2 = int(input("enter second number: "))
print(math.gcd(num1,num2))


# output
# enter firt number: 20 
# enter second number: 28
# 4
